A risk ratio is a formula that is useful across a wide variety of analyses, including vaccine effectiveness, pay-to-play meetings with politicians, employment discrimination, and TSA security screening. Although the formula is simple, there are  connections to deep topics like false positive rates, causal inferrence, and the important notion of conditional probability."
